Think about when you go to a restaurant when you go to a restaurant you want food.
You don't want to talk with the server the waiter although you do.
You don't want to talk with a chef although you kind of do to some extent.

How does the knowledge of your food get to the chef.

We could take that a step further and think the chef is an interface between the server and the food

server knows nothing about cooking and knows nothing about what the chef does the only thing the server

is doing is asking a person the chef something and then food magically appears.
If you were the server you would think the chef is an interface between you and some magical food producing

The A and the P in API. It stands for application programming.

SOAP and REST
Soap fallen off the radar recently.

server.

And to remember it is just an interaction between client server is just an interface between a client

HTTP > Stands for hypertext transfer protocol
Uniform Resource identifier the website you're requesting.
