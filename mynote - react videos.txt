React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
	-component based , each  has props and states
	-using ES6 (class instead of prototype)
	-JSX(HTML inside JS)
	-components
		- functional components
		if there is no state, only take props, and constant
		- class-based components

	props 
		send data fro one component to another(data transfer)
		All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
		(*pure function  - do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.)
		
	state:
		define component's situation .for ex. onclicked
		can send state to another component with props
		
Virtual DOM :
	1.create copy of virtual DOM
	2.compare with old one
	3.render only changed component on real DOM
	increase performance;
